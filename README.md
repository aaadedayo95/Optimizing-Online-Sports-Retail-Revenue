# Project Description:

Sports clothing and athleisure attire is a thriving industry, with a market worth approximately $193 billion in 2021 and promising growth projections for the future. In this Kaggle notebook, we take on the role of a product analyst for an online sports clothing company. Our objective is to explore product data and provide recommendations to improve revenue generation.
Project Overview

The company has provided us with a comprehensive database called "sports" that consists of five tables, all linked by the primary key "product_id." These tables contain valuable information, including pricing, reviews, descriptions, ratings, revenue, and website traffic. By leveraging this data, we aim to generate insights that will assist the marketing and sales teams in enhancing their strategies.
Table Descriptions

The "sports" database includes the following tables:

    info: Contains product details such as the product name, unique product ID, and description.
    finance: Provides financial information such as listing price, sale price, discounts, and revenue for each product.
    reviews: Includes product-specific data such as ratings and the number of reviews.
    traffic: Tracks website traffic by recording the last visit timestamp for each product.
    brands: Stores information about the brands associated with each product.
